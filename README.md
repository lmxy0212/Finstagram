A database project, a web application for sharing photos. Finstagram gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which photos they post. The focus of the project will be on storing data about who posted which photos and who has permission to view them, tag others in them, see who’s tagged in what, etc.
